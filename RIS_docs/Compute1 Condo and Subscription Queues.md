# Overview

- This documentation describes compute group and queue designations and their uses.
- For users (established and new) that only use the general queue, this information isnâ€™t needed to use the Compute Platform.
- This documentation is for those that have a condo or subscription tier.

# Designations of Groups and Queues

- The following is a list of the group name examples and queue names associated with the various subscriptions.

|  **Subscription**    |  **Group Name (-G)**            |  **Queue Name (-q)**    |  **Availability**    |
|:---------------------|:--------------------------------|:------------------------|:---------------------|
| General              | `${compute-group}`              | `general`               | Available            |
| Condo                | `${compute-group}`              | `${condo-name}`         | Available            |
| Tier 1 Subscription  | `${compute-subscription-group}` | `subscription`          | Available            |
| Tier 2 Subscription  | `${compute-subscription-group}` | `subscription`          | Available            |
| Tier 3 Subscription  | `${compute-subscription-group}` | `subscription`          | Available            |

- `${compute-group}` and `${compute-subscription-group}` should be replaced with the designation associated with the lab or research group the subscription is associated with, commonly this will be a PI washukey.

  - Example: `${compute-group}` becomes `compute-ris` for the RIS group
- More information on the different subscriptions available can be found here: <https://ris.wustl.edu/services/compute/resources/>

# General Queue

- The general queue is the base subscription. All active compute users have access to this queue.
- There are no guaranteed resources associated with a general subscription.
- The following example shows how the group name and queue name will look for the general queue.
- This queue is used as the example in the rest of the compute documentation examples elsewhere.
- You can find the general queue policies [RIS Services Policies](../RIS%20Services%20Policies.md)

```
#general queue (batch job)
bsub -q general -G ${compute-group} -a 'docker(alpine)' /bin/sleep 60

#general-interactive queue (interactive job)
bsub -Is -q general-interactive -G ${compute-group} -a 'docker(alpine)' /bin/bash
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - `${compute-group}` should be replaced with the name of your compute group
> - This will be provided at time of compute activation for your group.

# Condo Queue

- A condo queue is a queue associated with a purchased condo.
- More information about condos can be found here: <https://ris.wustl.edu/services/compute/compute-condo/>
- The resources available in this queue are dependent on physical resources purchased as part of the condo.
- Below is an example of how to run a job command in a condo queue.

```
bsub -q ${condo-name} -G ${compute-group} -a 'docker(alpine)' /bin/sleep 60
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - `${condo-name}` should be replaced with the name of your condo queue
> - `${compute-group}` should be replaced with the name of your compute group
> - These will be provided at time of activation for your group.

# Subscription Tier Queue

- A subscription tier is associated with a number of resources that are guaranteed for use based on the tier.
- There are currently three subscription tiers.
- Tier 1 Resources

  - 25 vCPUs
  - 1 GPU
- Tier 2 Resources

  - 50 vCPUs
  - 2 GPU
- Tier 3 Resources

  - 100 vCPUs
  - 3 GPU
- If you go over on the number of guaranteed vCPUs for a job submitted in this queue type, your job will not be guaranteed to run.
- If you go over on the number of guaranteed GPUs for a job submitted in this queue type, the job will stay in pending and never run.
- The `-sla` option is required for jobs submitted in this queue type.
- You can check out what sla a job used via the following command.

  ```
  bjobs -al ${job-id}
  ```
- This will list out a lot of information about the job, but the `Service Class` entry will list the sla used.

  ```
  Job <10006>, User <elyn>, Project <default>, Application <docker1>, Job Group <
                      /elyn/default>, Service Class <dev_elyn_t3>, User Group <c
                      ompute-dev-elyn-t3>, Status <RUN>, Queue <subscription>, J
                      ob Priority <50>, Command <sleep 10m>, Share group charged
                      </compute-dev-elyn-t3/>, Esub <docker(ubuntu:focal)>
  ```
- How to run a job using the subscription tier.

```
#batch (non-interactive)
bsub -q subscription -G ${compute-subscription-group} -sla ${sla-name} -a 'docker(alpine)' /bin/sleep 60

#interactive job
bsub -Is -q subscription -G ${compute-subscription-group} -sla ${sla-name} -a 'docker(alpine)' /bin/bash
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Replace `${compute-subscription-group}` with the intended compute subscription group.
> - Replace `${sla-name}` with sla name associated with your subscription.
> - These will be provided at time of activation for your group.

# Additional Information

- The group name and queue must match or the job will not be submitted. An example of what this mismatch and the error it produces looks like is below.

```
bsub -oo /dev/null -q ${condo-name} -G ${compute-subscription-group} -a 'docker(alpine)' /bin/sleep 60
You must select an LSF User group that matches the condo type. Example: ${compute-group}
Request aborted by esub. Job not submitted.
```

- In the example, the condo queue was designated but the group name used was one associated with a tier subscription.
- This will affect the potential pipelines of users who had access to the Compute Platform before this change and are moving to a different subscription than the base, which is the general queue.
