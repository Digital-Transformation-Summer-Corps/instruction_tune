## Where to Begin

Check out the RIS Compute and Storage Platform User Agreement and Policies

- [RIS Services Policies](RIS%20Services%20Policies.md)

Check out our FAQ page to see frequent questions or issues.

- [FAQ](FAQ.md)

## RIS Scientific Compute Platforms\*

New to the Compute Platform or HPC or want to move quickly to analysis? Start here!

- [Compute1 Quickstart](Compute1/Compute1%20Quickstart.md)

Looking for a particular software? Check out our installed, supported and vetted app pages for Docker containers with various software ready to go.

- [THPC Installed Applications](Applications/Compute1%20Applications/THPC%20Installed%20Applications.md)
- [RIS Developed Containers](Applications/Compute1%20Applications/RIS%20Developed%20Containers.md)
- [Non-RIS Docker Images](Applications/Non-RIS%20Docker%20Images.md)

Want to get started without knowledge of Docker or a strong grasp of the command line? Check out our documentation on using Open On Demand, a GUI based system for utilizing the Scientific Compute Platforms.

- [Open OnDemand](Compute1/Open%20OnDemand.md)

Do you have a Condo or Subscription Tier model? Check out our LSF Queues documentation for how to use those queues.

- [Compute1 Condo and Subscription Queues](Compute1/Compute1%20Condo%20and%20Subscription%20Queues.md)

Looking to develop code or software? Check out the documentation on using Visual Studio Code.

- [Visual Studio Code on Compute1](Compute1/Visual%20Studio%20Code%20on%20Compute1.md)

Don’t see what you’re looking for? Then checkout out our complete documentation on the Compute Platform or on Compute Topics.

- [Compute1](Compute1.md)
- [Compute2](Compute2.md)

## RIS Data Storage Platforms\*

Check out the differences between Storage2 and Storage1.

- [Storage2 Access Control](Storage%20Platforms/Storage2%20Access%20Control.md)

Check out the pages below for information on how to connection to the Storage Platforms from Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.

- [Connecting to Storage from MacOS](Storage%20Platforms/Connecting%20to%20Storage%20from%20MacOS.md)
