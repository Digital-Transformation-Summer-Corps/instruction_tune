# Single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis using R

This virtual workshop is offered in collaboration with WUITâ€™s Research  
Infrastructure Services (RIS) and the Institute for Informatics. The  
workshop will provide an introduction to using the RIS Scientific Compute  
Platform and R for scRNA-seq data analysis. Attendees will learn via live  
demonstrations how to submit scRNA-Seq data analysis tasks and explore  
the data using R packages.
