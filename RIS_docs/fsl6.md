# Run on LSF

## Preserve Environment variables

- Paths inside the container are not being preserved unless one sets this variable for the whole session.

  - export LSF\_DOCKER\_PRESERVE\_ENVIRONMENT=false
  - Prepend LSF\_DOCKER\_PRESERVE\_ENVIRONMENT=false before an individual bsub command (in which case the variable is only false for that command).
- If one fails to set preserve environment variable to false, one would have to provide each applicationâ€™s full path.

## bsub Command

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are a member of more than one compute group, you will be prompted to specify an LSF User Group with `-G group_name` or by setting the `LSB_SUB_USER_GROUP` variable.

- Interactive Session

  ```
  bsub -Is -q general-interactive -a 'docker(gcr.io/ris-registry-shared/<VERSION>)' /bin/bash
  ```
- Alternatively, if you want the preserve environment to only be false for one command.

  ```
  LSF_DOCKER_PRESERVE_ENVIRONMENT=false bsub -Is -q general-interactive -a 'docker(gcr.io/ris-registry-shared/<VERSION>)' /bin/bash
  ```
- Non-Interactive

  ```
  bsub -a 'docker(gcr.io/ris-registry-shared/<VERSION>)' {command & arguments to run}
  ```
