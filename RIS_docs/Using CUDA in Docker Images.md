# Overview

This documentation will guide you on making sure youâ€™re using the most appropriate CUDA version for your Docker image in regards to the Scientific Compute Platform.

# Using the Correct Version

Examples of appropriate base images:

```
nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-base-ubuntu22.04
nvidia/cuda:12.4.1-runtime-ubuntu22.04
ghcr.io/washu-it-ris/novnc:ubuntu22.04_cuda12.4_runtime
ghcr.io/washu-it-ris/novnc:ubuntu22.04_cuda12.4_devel
```

Nvidia has a lot of base images to develop from and can be found here: <https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/tags>

# Testing Your Image

Shown below are the steps to run a test job.

- Start up an interactive job with your Docker image.

  There is a test script in <https://github.com/WashU-IT-RIS/docker-osu-micro-benchmarks.git> for the OSU GPU test.
- Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/WashU-IT-RIS/docker-osu-micro-benchmarks.git
```

- Change directory to docker-osu-micro-benchmarks.

```
cd docker-osu-micro-benchmarks
```

- Run an OSU Benchmark GPU test.

  - Replace <test> with an OSU test that you want to run. For example, osu\_bw for OSU bandwidth test.
  - Replace <compute-group> with the compute group you are a member of.

```
QUEUE=subscription bin/osu-test-gpu.sh <test> -G <compute-group>
```
