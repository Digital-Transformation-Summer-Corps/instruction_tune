# Quick Start

## Interactive GUI Session

- Interactive GUI sessions are done via Open On Demand (OOD).

  - You can use the `SAS` application.
  - You can also use the `Compute RIS Desktop` application.
- You can find out more about OOD here: [Compute1 Quickstart](../../../Compute1/Compute1%20Quickstart.md).
- Fill out the fields with the appropriate information (explained in the quick start).
- Launch the job through the methods described in the quick start.
- If you use the `SAS` application, SAS will be started up automatically.
- If you use the `Compute RIS Desktop` application, please follow the steps below.

  - Once in an interactive session using the following commands to load and launch SAS.

  ```
  module load SAS
  sas
  ```

  - Versions available can be seen via the following command.

  ```
  module avail SAS
  ```

## Interactive Command-Line Session

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are a member of more than one compute group, you will be prompted to specify an LSF User Group with `-G group_name` or by setting the `LSB_SUB_USER_GROUP` variable.

- If you wish to use SAS in an interactive command-line session, you can do so via the THPC terminal.
- You can find out about using the THPC terminal [THPC](THPC.md)
- You load SAS just like in the OOD version.

```
module load SAS
```
