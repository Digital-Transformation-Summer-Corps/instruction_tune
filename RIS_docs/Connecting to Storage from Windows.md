> It may take a while for this login window to pop up the first time you connect to the storage drive. There aren’t any signs anything is loading, but don’t worry! If you have a connection to the WashU network, and you’ve correctly input the path name and hit Enter, it will work eventually.

If your login information is successfully validated, your storage drive will open in File Explorer.

# Creating a Desktop Shortcut

For easier access in the future, you can create a shortcut to your storage drive on your Desktop, the Start menu, the taskbar, or the File Explorer Quick Access tab. With your storage drive open, hover over the drive name and click and drag to create a shortcut.
