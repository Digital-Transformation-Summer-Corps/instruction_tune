# Requirements for Usage in RIS

## Initial Setup

- An initial setup of dependent files and directory structure in your compute home directory is required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Setup will create/modify the following in the compute home directory: `.afni/`, `.afnirc`, `.bashrc`, `.sumarc`.
> - In rare cases, $HOME is not /home/washukey. See the [Compute1 Quickstart](../../../Compute1/Compute1%20Quickstart.md) for details. If this is the case, enter echo $HOME and insert the result at the appropriate places below.

- Connect to compute and run the following, adjusting for individual compute username, home location, etc.

  ```
  LSF_DOCKER_VOLUMES='/home/washukey:/home/washukey' PATH=/home/washukey:/linux_centos_7_64:$PATH
  bsub -q general-interactive -Is -a 'docker(gcr.io/ris-registry-shared/afni-tortoise)' /bin/bash -c "cp /linux_centos_7_64/AFNI.afnirc ~/.afnirc; suma -update_env; apsearch -update_all_afni_help; /bin/bash"
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - If you are a member of more than one compute group, you will be prompted to specify an LSF User Group with `-G group_name` or by setting the `LSB_SUB_USER_GROUP` variable.
> - Paste the following in its entirety and run to append the .bashrc file.

```
cat <<EOF >> $HOME/.bashrc
ahdir=`apsearch -afni_help_dir`
if [ -f "$ahdir/all_progs.COMP.bash" ]
then
    . $ahdir/all_progs.COMP.bash
fi
export R_LIBS=/usr/local/lib/R/library/â€™
EOF
```

- Update shell.

```
. ~/.bashrc
```

## Run on LSF

- Connect to compute and run the following, adjusting for individual parameters and replacing <tag> with the appropriate version.

```
LSF_DOCKER_VOLUMES='/home/washukey:/home/washukey' PATH=/home/washukey:/linux_centos_7_64:$PATH
bsub -q general-interactive -Is -a 'docker(gcr.io/ris-registry-shared/afni-tortoise:<tag>)' /bin/bash
```
